[Happy Little Dinosaurs](https://unstablegames.com/collections/happy-little-dinosaurs/products/happy-little-dinosaurs-base-game) is a board game by [Unstable Games](https://unstablegames.com). It's an adorable little game with cute characters and art, and a handful of expansions too! Here though, I'll explore what the base game contains and its rules.
