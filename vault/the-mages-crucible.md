## Summary
I believe working openly with a community can lead to better projects, and faster learning for everyone. To that end, I've created a Discord server to accommodate that, as well as have a place to get feedback on projects, find team mates, and hang out.

Primarily a Gamedev community, this is a place for creatives to work together, find team mates, and get feedback on their projects. I want to create a positive, welcoming environment where everyone feels safe to share ideas, thoughts, and feedback.
## Rules
1. Abide by Discord's Terms of Service.
2. Be supportive, and empathetic, respect individual opinions, and embrace a wide range of skills and experience levels.
3. Respectfully challenge ideas, but avoid attacking others. Engage in constructive discussions and focus on ideas rather than personal criticisms.
4. No advertising outside of specific threads where appropriate, such as project and social links in project and portfolio threads.
