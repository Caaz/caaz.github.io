# Overview
_Nightfall_ is a 3D stealth horror game where players take on the role of a predatory monster hunting the inhabitants of a small, secluded fantasy village. As the monster, the player’s objective is to eliminate townsfolk while avoiding detection and adapting to the townsfolk’s attempts to identify and hunt them down. Each monster provides a unique gameplay experience, with specialized movement, sensory abilities, and limitations.

# Core Gameplay Pillars
1. Dynamic NPC Responses
	- Townsfolk are initially unaware of the threat, but as they recognize danger, they react, adjust routines, and hunt the monster.
1. Atmospheric Tension
	- The game relies heavily on visual and auditory cues to create suspense, with lighting, sound design, and shaders used to represent each monster's unique perception.
1. Replayability
	- With each monster offering distinct gameplay mechanics and challenges, players are encouraged to replay and master each creature's unique hunting style.

# Gameplay Mechanics
## Monster Abilities and Movement
Each monster has unique characteristics that impact its movement, perception, and hunting strategies. Possible monster characteristics may include: 
1. Predatory Vision
	- Utilizing unique cameras and shaders, the player would see what the monster sees, whether that be vibration based vision, heat signatures, night vision, or visual cues for smells.
1. Movement Constraints
	- Some monsters would have limited movement, relying on the shadows, burrowing underground, or being repelled by specific items, smells, or magic.
1. Unique Attacks
	- Each monster should have a signature attack or approach that aligns with its theme, such as bursting from the ground, or pulling someone into a void.

## NPC Behaviors and Reactions
NPCs in the town have routines they follow based on the time of day, but as the monster attacks they adapt by:
1. Defensive Measures
	- NPCs might start carrying torches, group together, or alert others of dangers
1. Improvised Weapons
	- While there may be dedicated hunters in town, other NPCs might resort to using whatever they may have at their disposal to fend off, or actively pursue the monster
1. Panic System
	- Each individual NPC would have a fear level that rises as they become aware of the monster's presence. This affects their actions and makes them more susceptible to making mistakes the player can take advantage of

## Environment Interactions
The village environment is interactive and responds to both the player and NPC actions.
1. Hiding and Camoflauge
	- Certain monsters might be able to hide within certain environments such as bushes, or in the shadows. Likewise, NPCs might use the same hiding places.
1. Dynamic Lighting
	- Light is both a threat and a tool. The monster may extinguish light sources, while NPCs may attempt to illuminate dark areas.
