I had an idea about how to do arbitrary ingredient -> recipe lookups and now I have to write it down. So! This came to me while working in color spaces, which has shown me the various ways we can store and manipulate colors in 3d space. What occurred to me is within those 3D spaces are big blobs of color we'd associate with a singular color name. despite there being many values. They're not always the same shape, so distance alone isn't good enough to mark something as "red" and the color space itself may be warped in ways that are unintuitive at a glance.
