This game is for the [Cosmic Horrors Jam IV](https://itch.io/jam/cosmichorrorsjam4)! I'm writing this before the jam starts as I've already got an idea in mind that should be easy to develop, and let me flex some art skills along the way.

## The Plan
I'd like to create a game heavily inspired by [Happy Little Dinosaurs](https://unstablegames.com/collections/happy-little-dinosaurs/products/happy-little-dinosaurs-base-game), a very simple boardgame where you take your dinosaur character from one end of the board to the other, each turn facing a different disaster, and you use items to hopefully escape. I'll do some research on [[game-dives/happy-little-dinosaurs/index|Happy Little Dinosaurs, found here]]. Then I'll lay out how this game rethemes it and differs.

### Retheming
Disasters are **Horrors**, each a style of horror found in the cosmic horror genre.

Player characters are human, each representing a character within your typical film-noir story

Point cards and instant cards will be joined as **Action Cards**. An action card will have effects that can trigger in your hand, when played, during ties, etc.

## Rules

There are two decks, an Action Deck and a Horror Deck

The Action Deck contains 21 cards: a set of 7 point cards ranging from 1-7, 3 each.
The Horror Deck contains 20 cards: 
- 6 Arcane Horrors
- 6 Anomaly Horrors
- 6 Monstrosity Horrors
- 2 Cosmic Horrors (Which count as Arcane, Anomaly and Monstrosity)

There are three Roles players can choose from:
- Detective: +1 to Monstrosity Horrors, -1 to Anomaly Horrors
- Scientist: +1 to Arcane Horrors, -1 to Monstrosity Horrors
- Cultist: +1 to Anomaly Horrors, -1 to Arcane Horrors

At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a role and draws 3 cards.

At the beginning of a turn, a horror card is drawn from the horror deck and revealed to all players. Each player plays a card from their hand face down. Drawing a card to replace the card played. When all players have played their cards, they're flipped simultaneously, and the player with the lowest points takes the horror card.

Scoring: Each action card has a value associated with it ranging from 1-7, the player who played the card may also have a score adjustment based on their role. For example if a Detective is playing an action of 4 against a monstrosity horror, their total score is 5 due to the +1 to monstrosity detective has.

If two players tie for lowest score, they play a second card and score those as well. (Drawing to replace the card played as well). They repeat this step until the tie is broken.

If any player collects 3 of the same type of horror, they lose the game.

To win, you must be the last player in the game.
