## Inspirations
### Pokémon Pinball (RSE)
I played a ton of Pokémon Pinball growing up, part of what made me love it was pokédex filling which kept me stuck to it for much longer than any other pinball game
### Space Cadet Pinball
This is probably the only other Pinball game I've ever played. Scoreboard topping was a big deal.
### Cassette Beasts
I really like the vfx, style, and themes of Cassette Beasts.

## Quick Pitch
A pinball game where the player acts as the "**Geistcatcher**", capturing loose spirits and using their powers to control the ball.
## Core Features
### Monster Collecting
Each **ghost** will have their own power
