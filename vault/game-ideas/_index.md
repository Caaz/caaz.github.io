## Summary
Like most game developers I have many, many ideas. I absolutely won't make all of them, and some I may not even have a full enough idea to write a game design document. Here's where I'll write a quick one-sentence-pitch to describe an idea I have, and if I ever have the time, I'll write up a design doc for it too.

## To-do
These games don't have pages yet, but once I get time, I'll write them up!
