I need a setting for this game that allows for
- [ ] A good amount of unique enemies
- [ ] Enemies drop unique items for the player to create gear with
- [ ] Players to have a home/base/town to return to between dungeon crawls
- [ ] Tower/Path style "floors", where there are clear entrances and exits.
- [ ] A goal at the end of dungeon, potential boss.

## Options
### Alien Invasion
- [x] A good amount of unique enemies
	- Aliens offer a wide range of infinite options pretty much.
- [x] Enemies drop unique items for the player to create gear with
	- Feral, animal-like aliens might have organic matter to harvest and use. Poisons, bones, etc.
	- More sentient-like aliens could drop weapons or armor, or just tech shards or something the player can use to make weapons or armor.
- [x] Players to have a home/base/town to return to between dungeon crawls
	- The player can come from a town or village nearby
- [x] Tower/Path style "floors", where there are clear entrances and exits.
	- A path-style trip to the dungeon, where aliens are more creature-like, which would transition to a tower-like dungeon when the player reaches an alien monolith, or tower.
- [x] A goal at the end of dungeon, potential boss.
	- The top of the dungeon could feature a boss-sized alien, or collection of aliens controlling the area.
