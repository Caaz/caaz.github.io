Every now and then I get the itch to play a fishing minigame. Which fishing minigame? Doesn't matter, they're all basically the same. Cast the line, wait for the !, press A, get fish or item. Terraria, Pokemon, FATE, Minecraft, etc.

I'm getting a little annoyed with how boring these minigames tend to be. I don't like the idea that any random square of water could have infinite fish and riches in it. I know there are games that are 100% fishing games, but I don't want an absurd amount of realism either. 

# What do I want?
- Fish should be visible in the water
	- Fish don't just sprout from the water cause I'm fishing, they should be there as an expendable resource!
- Casting a line should be more interactive, I want control over where I throw the bobber
	- What if I'm on a cliff overlooking the ocean? I wanna toss a line as far as possible!
- I want to explore, in search of new fishing spots!
	- If every fish can be caught anywhere, then there's no reason to explore
- I want unique fish
	- I'm not really a fish person, but I bet I could make up some that fit an environment.

# How do I want it?
- 3D environment
	- It's easier to convey depth, and my skills are all 3D anyway
- Dungeons?
	- I just like the feel of them. 
- Fantasy?
	- More unique fish options!
