Going into this, I had assumed haiku were simple 5/7/5 constructions. I was wrong beyond expectations. I've learned there's a lot of features to them that should be considered, which makes reading a good one have more depth than I originally expected.

## Characteristics
>In Japanese, a traditional haiku is a one-line poem that describes two things. However, in English, a traditional haiku usually has three lines arranged in a 5-7-5 pattern. The Haiku Society of America has two definitions of a haiku. The first defines the Japanese haiku as an unrhymed poem "recording the essence of a moment keenly perceived, in which Nature is linked to human nature" consisting of 17 _on_. The second definition applies to English-language haiku: "A foreign adaptation of the Japanese form, usually written in three lines totaling fewer than 17 syllables."[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-HSA_def-1) In a book chapter discussing haiku form, Sato emphasizes that the definition does not say how many syllables each line ought to have.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTESato202333-2)

>Haiku are normally associated with a focus on nature or the seasons and a division into two asymmetrical sections that juxtaposes two subjects (e.g. something natural and something human-made, two unexpectedly similar things, etc.).[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-HSA_def-1)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHigginson1985116%E2%80%93117-3) This juxtaposition was an important technique for haiku in English in both the 20th and 21st centuries.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTERosenow2022248-4) There is usually a contemplative or wistful tone and an impressionistic brevity that lends the form to an emphasis on imagery, especially sensory imagery.[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-5)[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-6)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-7) Haiku can contain occasional simile and metaphor.[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHigginson1985124-8) Some haiku experts, like Robert Speiss and Jane Reichold, have said that a haiku should be expressed in a single breath.[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-9)[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-10)[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English#cite_note-11)

## Elements
*These are probably gross oversimplifications references below for more detailed understandings.*
### On: Syllabic meter
On is the syllables. This is the 5-7-5 pattern most people are familiar with, though some haiku break this rule.

I think I'll use the standard 5-7-5 pattern, unless there's a really good reason why I should break it.
### Kireji: Cutting Word
> There is no exact equivalent of _kireji_ in English, and its function can be difficult to define. It is said to supply structural support to the verse.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kireji#cite_note-1) When placed at the end of a verse, it provides a dignified ending, concluding the verse with a heightened sense of closure. Used in the middle of a verse, it briefly cuts the stream of thought, indicating that the verse consists of two thoughts half independent of each other.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kireji#cite_note-2) In such a position, it indicates a pause, both rhythmically and grammatically, and may lend an emotional flavour to the phrase preceding it.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kireji#cite_note-3)

> _Kireji_ have no direct equivalent in English. Mid-verse _kireji_ have been described as sounded rather than written punctuation. In [English-language haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English "Haiku in English") and hokku, as well as in translations of such verses into this language, _kireji_ may be represented by [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") (typically by a dash or an [ellipsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis "Ellipsis")), an [exclamatory particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exclamatory_particle&action=edit&redlink=1 "Exclamatory particle (page does not exist)") (such as 'how...'), or simply left unmarked.

This gives me the implication that the Kireji of a Haiku affects the tone and meaning of the rest of the Haiku.
#### Common kireji
A lot of these don't seem to have very specific similarities in english, but they enhance or modify words, suffixes, emphasizes stuff.

- _ka_ (か): emphasis; when at end of a phrase, it indicates a question
- _kana_ (哉/かな): emphasis; usually can be found at a poem's end, indicates wonder
- _-keri_ (〜けり): exclamatory verbal suffix, [past perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_perfect "Past perfect")
- _-ramu_ or _-ran_ (〜らむ/〜らん): verbal suffix indicating probability
- _-shi_ (〜し): adjectival suffix; usually used to end a clause
- _-tsu_ (〜つ): verbal suffix; [present perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_perfect "Present perfect")
- _ya_ (や): emphasises the preceding word or words. Cutting a poem into two parts, it implies an equation, while inviting the reader to explore their interrelationship.[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kireji#cite_note-6)

### Kigo: Season Word
This is a word that evokes the idea of the time of year in the poem. There's a few big lists of kigo, and they're very Japanese specific. 

As someone who spends most of my time indoors, and in California, this is going to be tough to implement. I basically deal with two seasons which ultimately boil down to "my AC is on and my power bill is high" being true or false. Seasons don't really exist here.

Thankfully, Kigo are *not always* included in modern haiku, or non-japanese haiku. Though, it might be interesting to evoke a sense of *time* in my haiku anyway. Thinking of the big-picture of these sets of haiku, I'd like to tell a story of my life, so maybe I could implement a kigo for the time in a lifetime, rather than for a single year.

## Plans going forward
So I've established a set of rules for the haiku I wish to write:
- It **should** follow the 5-7-5 syllable count.
	- But it **should** follow the rule of "being spoken in one breath" and I have asthma, so if I need to go shorter, that is allowed.
- It **must** have a **kireji**.
	- I shall define a kireji as a word that emphasizes the *idea* of the haiku. Adding conflict, allowing the reader to reflect on the piece as a whole. To me this feels like the most important part of a haiku, without it, it's just a sentence.
- It must have a **kigo**.
	- I'm going to define this as a word that emphasizes the time in my life.
- It **should** consist of small, simple words.
	- Larger words are hard to create in the gameplay of [[game-ideas/zen/_index|zen]], so I need to avoid that when possible.
	- I don't want to come off as using big words to be "profound". Poetry isn't my strong suit, and I don't want to belittle people's intelligence either. Art should be for everyone. 
	- Large words are also seen as *cheap* in the context of a haiku. I'd like to avoid that
- It **should** be personal, reflecting my life.
	- This is more to make these *unique*. Anyone can write on how hot it is during the summer. No one can write how it is to be me. Not as well as I could, at least.
	- I think what I'd like to do for the game is reveal the deeper meaning behind these haiku when the player completes the level. They'll have the time to contemplate it while playing, and be rewarded with actual concrete meaning when they complete it.
- It should reflect nature vs *my nature*
	- This is difficult. What is "nature", to me? I hate nature, it's foreign to me.
## Attempts
### Fractured Identity
Exploring identity, what it means to be a native american in a modern era. Does race even matter? 

- Tribal lands not known / lines of code fill my passion / what is my culture?
- Tribal chants fade off; keyboard clacks echo within. Stranger to kin's call
- tribal chants quiet / key press clacks echo within / Stranger to my kin
#### 
- [x] 5-7-5
- [x] Kireji
	- `culture?`emphasizes the confusion of my identity, emphasizing the difference between tribal lands and software.
- [x] Small, simple words
	- I could argue fulfill might be too much. 
- [x] Personal
	- It reflects my identity, something I've thought a lot about growing up, and how it contrasts with my career path and passions. I've never felt close to my tribe at all, and getting close feels... difficult.
- [x] Nature
- [ ] Kigo
	- There's no time here, this is kind of a constant in my life... Hm.

### Father's Day
The oddity of not knowing my father, not knowing how a father should be, and becoming one.
#### My first father's day / not as son, but as father / how do I do this?
- [x] 5-7-5
- [x] Kireji
	- `how/this?` emphasizing that I'm lost with this whole concept
- [x] Small, simple words
- [x] Personal
	- I never really knew my father. I know who he is, but not who he is as a person. I wasn't raised by him, or with him. He had the chance, but I was ignored. Now, my first father's day celebration will be as a father myself. I don't know how to even do this.
- [ ] Nature
	- Not sure how to incorporate nature into this, unless you can argue family is a form of nature.
- [x] Kigo
	- `father's day` giving a nice point in the year.

### A Class Assignment

#### Rain clouds the bright sun / words on page, a teacher's tears / I hope for an A.
- [x] 5-7-5
- [x] Kireji
	- `I hope for an A` I'm hoping this line gives a good change of pace enough to consider it kireji.
- [x] Small, simple words
- [x] Personal
	- While in continuation high school, my English class, I was asked to write a story about growing up. I'm not particularly creative enough to lie, and I figured because of the school, she's probably heard worse stories than mine. Continuation high schools are full of kids who didn't have a great experience growing up, usually. So, I was honest. I wrote everything I could remember, a two page hand written "This is my story." She cried as she read it, tears wound up on the page itself. When it was handed back I got an A+. It was exciting, for me! The story was nothing new to me, but it held a weight for her that I'll probably never really know.
