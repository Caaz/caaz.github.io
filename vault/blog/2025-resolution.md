## Resolution
I want to stop saying "I'm not an artist" and start doing art, start being comfortable with fucking up, and generally be more creative with all tasks I do.

### Reasoning
I've always felt like "I can't do that" when approaching creative tasks, but over the last year I touched on many artistic projects and did just fine. AI has become a **big deal** and through it I learned that even if I'm bad, I'm still a hell of a lot better than whatever image generation models can pump out, because at least *I* can follow instruction.

Most of the difficulty I've faced when doing art has been landing on a consistent art style. I don't really have one, and I think that's going to be the toughest challenge to overcome.

## Hard goals
I feel it's important with any resolution to have hard goals, otherwise how do you say that you've done it?

- [ ] Find an "art style" that I want to cultivate.
	- [[blog/art-as-a-developer/index|In progress over here!]]
- [ ] Do a self portrait!
- [ ] Add more images to this site, hand drawn, rendered out, whatever.
- [ ] Figure out real-time VFX for game assets!
- [ ] Create a character!
- [ ] Figure out Blender's [Non-Linear Animation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/nla/index.html) tool.
- [ ] Figure out Animation blending in Godot/Blender?
- [ ] Do some creative writing, an original story.
- [ ] Learn some audio stuff? How to master properly, maybe learn some foley stuff?

## Accomplishments

### "Fun" and Games Podcast
I recorded an episode for a podcast! In it, I told the story of my RimWorld colony! I think if I want to do more recordings of myself, I should probably get a better microphone, the one I have barely picks me up, or perhaps I'm not using it properly. In any case, it doesn't have a stand and I had to hold it in a cup for the entirety of the recording, so It's probably a good idea to get a new one anyway.
