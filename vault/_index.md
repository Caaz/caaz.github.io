## About me
Hi! My name is Daniel, but I usually go by **Caaz**. I've been developing professionally for ten years now, and as a hobbyist for twenty. Growing up, I always wanted to develop video games, because I couldn't afford any. Programming was a means to entertainment for me, and that never stopped. I really enjoy stumbling onto interesting problems and finding ways of solving them. 
Most of what I know is self-taught, while I did go to Fresno City college, it was more a formality to prove to potential employers that I know what I'm doing, and the professors there leaned heavily on presenting Youtube videos as class materials, which wasn't much of an education anyway

## What's here
This site is where I publish living documents. Many of the links may shift with time, and the documents within them may change as well, if you'd like to save a particular page for long term use, you're likely better off finding the commit in the [public github repository](https://github.com/Caaz/caaz.github.io) for this site and saving that. To view and edit files on this site, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), there's a vault in the repo that uses an html export feature to generate this site, with a few tweaks here and there for style and icon changes.
### Game Design Documents
Here, I'll write up game design documents, sometimes these will be just practice to get an idea of how to write one of these properly and get feedback, other times they may be actual games I plan on creating. In either case, you are free to use the ideas there for your own games, worst case scenario I can't imagine anyone would be able to create exactly the game I have in mind, and if they do, well then I don't have to make it, win win!
Usually, I'll try to think of a one-sentence-pitch before writing a design document, you can find those over in Game ideas #TODO

### Notes
Everything you find here will be personal opinions, written from my point of view regarding development, project management, retrospectives and the likes. If you've ever wanted to get an idea of what I really think about things, that's where you'll find it.
