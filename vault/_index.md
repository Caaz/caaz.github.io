## About me
Hi! My name is **Daniel**, but online, I go by **Caaz**. With over ten years of professional experience and twenty years as a hobbyist developer under my belt, you can bet I'm passionate about programming, architecture, and 

I've always learned best when teaching others what I know. That's why you'll see me sharing articles, tutorials, and code examples on this site - it helps me solidify my own understanding of topics and ensures that everything is explained in a way that's easy to grasp for all levels of experience.

## About this site
This site is dedicated to publishing **living documents**. The content here is constantly evolving as I continue learning and growing. Feel free to explore the history of the site and its articles through its [Github repository](https://github.com/Caaz/caaz.github.io). It might even give you some valuable insights into how my thoughts have developed over time!

### Development
This site was built using a variety of tools, frameworks, and good ol hyper-fixation. The pages are rendered via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using a custom theme developed by myself, using the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

I write my content through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a markdown editor. To get cross-page links working, I've utilized [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export), a rust CLI tool which converts obsidian markdown to a more standardized markdown format that Hugo can recognize (with a few tweaks in the rendering pipeline to ensure some specific bits are rendered properly.)

All of this comes together nicely via [Github Actions](https://github.com/Caaz/caaz.github.io/actions) which build the site from the source code, ensuring I don't need to handle building and publishing manually, it's just *magic*. Would I recommend going through this much effort? Absolutely not.

### Nothing here is written in stone

Most of what you can find here is my personal opinion, and it's all subject to change! I'm always willing to discuss anything, and provide my point of view on any subject. I find writing very enjoyable, and I know I'm not infallible. Some day I'll likely read back on all of this and probably feel a little embarrassed, but that's part of growing, and I find it important.
