The basic idea is that the reader of our code mostly cares about the \"happy path\". This breaks most functions down into two parts: \"Check invalid states\", \"Do what the function is named for\"For example, let's take a look at this load_level function. func load_level(index:int) -&gt; void: # Check invalid sates if levels.size() &lt; index: printerr(\"Invalid level index: {0}\".format(index)) return if not is_instance_valid(game_node): return # Do the thing for child in game_node.get_children(): child.queue_free() var level = levels[index].instantiate() game_node.add_child(level) hide()\nIt needs to grab a scene from a levels array, instantiate it, and add it as a child to another node. This means we need to check two things:\nIs the level index we're trying to add even valid?\nIs the node we intend on placing our level a valid node?\nIf those two succeed, we know we can go on with our process and we're reasonably certain that the function should succeed. If either fail, the function simply does nothing. If we wanted, in the future we could check that if you're loading an already loaded level, it'd also do nothing. This would make the method idempotent. Returning early really only works for void functions, as functions that return a typed value shouldn't just return void all of a sudden. If we expect an integer, it should return an integer. In Godot, there are functions that explicitly return a value, and error when they cannot. For example, raycasts:if raycast.is_colliding(): var point = raycast.get_collision_point()\nif you were to call get_collision_point without is_colliding == true, then it'd raise an error, this leaves it up to the implementer to only call the method when it can be called.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Return Early","level":1,"id":"Return_Early_0"},{"heading":"Caveats","level":2,"id":"Caveats_0"},{"heading":"Non-void functions","level":3,"id":"Non-void_functions_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"notes/godot/error-handling.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":0,"modifiedTime":1733457948795,"sourceSize":2208,"sourcePath":"Notes/Godot/Error Handling.md","exportPath":"notes/godot/error-handling.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html":{"title":"Node and Scene References","icon":"","description":"Like all programming problems, referencing a node or scene in a Godot script can be done in many ways. I've found that some of these ways can raise issues during development that can cause problems, and should probably be avoided because of it.# via find_child\n@onready var some_node = find_child(\"SomeNode\")\n# via $Name\n@onready var some_node = $SomeNode\n# via unique name\n@onready var some_node = %SomeNode\n# via export\n@export var some_node:Node\nThe first two suffer from an annoying issue, if we happen to restructure the scene's tree, and move SomeNode to a child of a different node, the script breaks, and we have to go in and modify the script to resolve it.The third option is safe from that problem of course, but it runs into a different issue: If you happen to change that node's name, it once again breaks our script causing us to refactor again.The fourth however, an exported variable, I believe is the best solution, it's immune from both of the previous issues, as godot will track when the name or location of the node changes. Additionally, it forces us to properly type hint the node.Scene references have less options for referencing them, but again, I'd avoid hard-coding the path for scenes in a script, as again, moving that file around will break that script. An exported variable instead work well to avoid that.@export var some_scene:PackedScene\nCircular Dependencies can happen with the exported variable approach for scenes specifically. If for example, you have scene_a with an exported variable to scene_b, then have scene_b with an exported variable to scene_a, neither scene will be loadable by the Godot editor.This issue is difficult to notice, as you can set it up in the editor, and while the project is in memory, it's fine. The error only arises when loading the scene into memory. Regularly reloading the project on git merges is a good practice to avoid one of these slipping by.In these scenarios, it might actually be easier to hard-code the scene locations, perhaps in a global autoload script, as at least then if it breaks a script, it'll only break one script.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Caveats","level":1,"id":"Caveats_0"},{"heading":"Circular Dependencies","level":2,"id":"Circular_Dependencies_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":0,"modifiedTime":1733457948795,"sourceSize":2175,"sourcePath":"Notes/Godot/Node and Scene References.md","exportPath":"notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"notes/godot/project-structure.html":{"title":"Project Structure","icon":"","description":"Generally, the project structure I've seen most is as follows:addons (third party plugins and assets)\nassets art sprites tiles backgrounds ui vfx audio music sfx\nresources\nscenes (.tscn files)\nscripts (.gd files)\nshaders\nWhat winds up happening is the scripts wind up in the scenes folder and we wind up refactoring eventually which can get messy.\nI suggest a scene oriented approach instead:addons (third party stuff)\nart sprites tiles backgrounds ui vfx\naudio music sfx\nresources\nscenes (example_scene_folder) (example.tscn) (example.gd)\nscripts (global_script.gd)\nshaders\nThe goal here is to take advantage of godot's default script placement (in the folder of the screen it's being instantiated in), so that its default will place it with the scene it's related to. Additionally, this'll mean scenes with a lot of scripts specific to it will be placed in its scene folder, which will contain its messiness.Another benefit, is it'll be very clear which scripts are actually in use and not just leftover from some deleted scene, as if we delete a scene, we'd delete its folder, and all scripts related to it.Additionally, this makes art and audio top level, there's not a massive benefit to stuffing them into assets, they deserve to be first class citizens!The scripts folder that does exist here will be specifically for global, autoload singleton scripts only.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"notes/godot/project-structure.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":0,"modifiedTime":1733457948795,"sourceSize":1426,"sourcePath":"Notes/Godot/Project Structure.md","exportPath":"notes/godot/project-structure.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"notes/godot/resolving-conflicts.html":{"title":"Resolving Conflicts","icon":"","description":"When using git, Godot scenes (.tscn) files tend to conflict very easily, any new node or resource added to the scene will modify the first line of the scene file:[gd_scene load_steps=5 format=3 uid=\"uid://bdldxaka32a6w\"]\nTypically the difference is load_steps, looking into this, it's simply a counter Godot uses to render a loading screen. those steps is the count of resources it needs to load into memory. It appears that Godot will recalculate this value on saving the scene, so whichever half of the conflict is chosen doesn't seem to matter.External Resource conflicts are the more messy problem. External resources are defined in scenes like so:[ext_resource type=\"Script\" path=\"res://scripts/main_menu.gd\" id=\"1_427ti\"]\nEach external resource has a path and an id, the id is used to reference that resource throughout the scene, like so:script = ExtResource(\"1_427ti\")\nIn the event that Godot returns a \"missing resource\" error and the resource is defined in the scene, it's likely that we've got a circular dependency.

Over the years I've really discovered what values I consider important to me while working, and I think those values would be useful to those who want to work with me in the future.\nHere you can get the best idea of how best to utilize my skills and worth ethics to ensure my productivity is maximized and your expectations are in line with what quality I can provide.One of my major motivators is learning, everything else is second to that. I find enjoyment in learning new skills and applying them, and when I'm not doing that, it's all just busywork. I don't enjoy taking on projects that I know I can do, I prefer to push my limits and ensure I get the maximum value out of everything I work on.\nI enjoy problem solving, I enjoy what I do. Don't make my work about money, I could work anywhere doing anything for money, If I agree to work on a project, it's because I want to, not because I have to.Product requirements, feature specifications, team agreements. Those should be a requirement before starting feature work. If the team isn't on the same page it is near impossible to work together effectively.\nAs a developer, I've always preferred a by-the-book approach to working in a team, without established guidelines, it's very difficult to even begin working together, as naming conventions, coding patterns, and approaches to problems can vary wildly. Documentation ensures all developers are guiding the code in the same direction.While developing, there's a common saying: \"Make it work, make it right, make it fast.\" However, a lot of developers stop at making it work, and considering that \"done.\" This is especially prevalent under tight deadlines, and I've seen this time and time again at startups and in game jams.\nI believe, even under tight deadlines, at the very least, \"make it right\" must be reached. This means good architecture and code patterns, and being aware of when a pattern can become a problem.If you want me in a meeting, serve a clear purpose. If you put me in a meeting where my participation is not explicitly required I will tune out the entire thing and socially auto-pilot my way through it all.\nI don't actually mind meetings, I could sit in one all day, but you won't get productivity code-wise out of me during one. I am near incapable of writing code while listening to people talk.Well, if you can get behind my key values, what I stand for as a developer, then feel free to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Index > Contact\" data-href=\"Index#Contact\" href=\"index.html#Contact_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">contact me</a>.
