The basic idea is that the reader of our code mostly cares about the \"happy path\". This breaks most functions down into two parts: \"Check invalid states\", \"Do what the function is named for\"For example, let's take a look at this load_level function. func load_level(index:int) -&gt; void: # Check invalid sates if levels.size() &lt; index: printerr(\"Invalid level index: {0}\".format(index)) return if not is_instance_valid(game_node): return # Do the thing for child in game_node.get_children(): child.queue_free() var level = levels[index].instantiate() game_node.add_child(level) hide()\nIt needs to grab a scene from a levels array, instantiate it, and add it as a child to another node. This means we need to check two things:\nIs the level index we're trying to add even valid?\nIs the node we intend on placing our level a valid node?\nIf those two succeed, we know we can go on with our process and we're reasonably certain that the function should succeed. If either fail, the function simply does nothing. If we wanted, in the future we could check that if you're loading an already loaded level, it'd also do nothing. This would make the method idempotent. Returning early really only works for void functions, as functions that return a typed value shouldn't just return void all of a sudden. If we expect an integer, it should return an integer. In Godot, there are functions that explicitly return a value, and error when they cannot. For example, raycasts:if raycast.is_colliding(): var point = raycast.get_collision_point()\nif you were to call get_collision_point without is_colliding == true, then it'd raise an error, this leaves it up to the implementer to only call the method when it can be called.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Return Early","level":1,"id":"Return_Early_0"},{"heading":"Caveats","level":2,"id":"Caveats_0"},{"heading":"Non-void functions","level":3,"id":"Non-void_functions_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Daniel Cavazos","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"caaz.me/notes/godot/error-handling.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":0,"modifiedTime":1733457948795,"sourceSize":2208,"sourcePath":"Notes/Godot/Error Handling.md","exportPath":"notes/godot/error-handling.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html":{"title":"Node and Scene References","icon":"","description":"Like all programming problems, referencing a node or scene in a Godot script can be done in many ways. I've found that some of these ways can raise issues during development that can cause problems, and should probably be avoided because of it.# via find_child\n@onready var some_node = find_child(\"SomeNode\")\n# via $Name\n@onready var some_node = $SomeNode\n# via unique name\n@onready var some_node = %SomeNode\n# via export\n@export var some_node:Node\nThe first two suffer from an annoying issue, if we happen to restructure the scene's tree, and move SomeNode to a child of a different node, the script breaks, and we have to go in and modify the script to resolve it.The third option is safe from that problem of course, but it runs into a different issue: If you happen to change that node's name, it once again breaks our script causing us to refactor again.The fourth however, an exported variable, I believe is the best solution, it's immune from both of the previous issues, as godot will track when the name or location of the node changes. Additionally, it forces us to properly type hint the node.Scene references have less options for referencing them, but again, I'd avoid hard-coding the path for scenes in a script, as again, moving that file around will break that script. An exported variable instead work well to avoid that.@export var some_scene:PackedScene\nCircular Dependencies can happen with the exported variable approach for scenes specifically. If for example, you have scene_a with an exported variable to scene_b, then have scene_b with an exported variable to scene_a, neither scene will be loadable by the Godot editor.This issue is difficult to notice, as you can set it up in the editor, and while the project is in memory, it's fine. The error only arises when loading the scene into memory. Regularly reloading the project on git merges is a good practice to avoid one of these slipping by.In these scenarios, it might actually be easier to hard-code the scene locations, perhaps in a global autoload script, as at least then if it breaks a script, it'll only break one script.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Caveats","level":1,"id":"Caveats_0"},{"heading":"Circular Dependencies","level":2,"id":"Circular_Dependencies_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Daniel Cavazos","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"caaz.me/notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":0,"modifiedTime":1733457948795,"sourceSize":2175,"sourcePath":"Notes/Godot/Node and Scene References.md","exportPath":"notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"notes/godot/project-structure.html":{"title":"Project Structure","icon":"","description":"Generally, the project structure I've seen most is as follows:addons (third party plugins and assets)\nassets art sprites tiles backgrounds ui vfx audio music sfx\nresources\nscenes (.tscn files)\nscripts (.gd files)\nshaders\nWhat winds up happening is the scripts wind up in the scenes folder and we wind up refactoring eventually which can get messy.\nI suggest a scene oriented approach instead:addons (third party stuff)\nart sprites tiles backgrounds ui vfx\naudio music sfx\nresources\nscenes (example_scene_folder) (example.tscn) (example.gd)\nscripts (global_script.gd)\nshaders\nThe goal here is to take advantage of godot's default script placement (in the folder of the screen it's being instantiated in), so that its default will place it with the scene it's related to.

It appears that Godot will recalculate this value on saving the scene, so whichever half of the conflict is chosen doesn't seem to matter.External Resource conflicts are the more messy problem. External resources are defined in scenes like so:[ext_resource type=\"Script\" path=\"res://scripts/main_menu.gd\" id=\"1_427ti\"]\nEach external resource has a path and an id, the id is used to reference that resource throughout the scene, like so:script = ExtResource(\"1_427ti\")\nIn the event that Godot returns a \"missing resource\" error and the resource is defined in the scene, it's likely that we've got a circular dependency.

Since Lootlocker is a sponsor of the jam, we also looked into implementing their leaderboard script into our project to use that service. The Jam ran from&nbsp;November 29th 2024 at 12:00 PM&nbsp;to&nbsp;December 2nd 2024 at 12:00 PM. <br>When the game stared the theme was revealed, Flow. From that we were immediately thinking of \"Flow State\" like one might get into while doing tricks on a skateboard, or other sports. Rhythm games were thought of as well. We were spitball many ideas via <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://miro.com/index/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://miro.com/index/\" target=\"_self\">Miro</a>.\nIt took a few hours but we started running with the idea of running from a volcano and lava while doing tricks to gain speed. Linguistically this almost made sense, but as we started work we realized lava flowing is fairly slow, and if the player is going fast, it's not really a problem anyway. It doesn't fit the \"Speedrunner\" playstyle, and why the player would be doing tricks didn't make sense either. We quickly pivoted and reorganized to pull back in a previous idea, ice skating.We would make an ice skating platformer game. By the end of the first day, we had a \"testbed\" level set up (which would later become Level 2) and a decent idea of what movement techniques we wanted the player to have. Wall kicks, jumps, acceleration and turning\nAt this point, we were still trying to figure out how to tie in \"tricks\" to gain the player speed, and were trying to implement a \"Dance Dance Revolution\" minigame any time the player jumped to give them a boost, but we very quickly realized that it would require quite a bit of effort to implement that, and be very difficult to pull off for the player. We simplified it to a single button press in the air, which became a meter draining ability.I worked during the days, while ArturGinRad worked during the nights, We did our best to track our work through Jira, but due to the short time of the jam, there wasn't a lot of time to check it or to update it, the benefit of jira was easily outweighed by the time it took to use it.\nMuch of Sunday I spent cleaning up the codebase and trying to make it more reusable, object-oriented, and it was those changes that inspired me to start these notes.\nBy the time I had run out of steam, there were still problems with the game, the last level's parallax wasn't set up properly, the leaderboard functionality didn't work, and the flow meter wasn't using the art we had done, which was intended to use some fancy shader tricks.We ranked #7 out of 104 entries.\nIt should be noted that everything here isn't on any one person, and part of a game jam is to learn how to do better. Retrospectives are an effort to not repeat the past, and learn from them. I think everyone did amazing, given the time constraints, and we got a pretty good score as well!\nI'm not sure any of us really had a good idea of speedrunning going into this jam, we had wildly different ideas of what to build for this, I think we kind of just picked something and ran. It probably would've helped to step back a bit and really dig into some of the best speedrunning games.One of the things I feel we could've done better is a usage of reusable scenes, as every level was a copied scene, the elements within it, the player, camera, end flag, tilemaps, were all copied and pasted, so if there were a bug in one, we'd have to make the same change across every level to resolve it. This was a huge problem regarding efficiency not only programming and architecture wise, but just in development time.Tilemaps didn't use autotiling features, and I think that would've sped up level design greatly, and I believe the only current warnings/errors in the game comes from the tilesets or tilemaps.<br>The use of Control nodes had to regularly be reorganized to scale nicely, and due to that the scripts kept breaking <a data-href=\"Node and Scene References\" href=\"caaz.me/notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Node and Scene References</a> was written after the jam to ensure I can avoid this problem in the future. A document should be written covering Control node layouts as well, so that we don't manually lay out everything going forward as well. A theme was also not set, requiring every button, font, padding, to be set manually.The script LootLocker provides is very long, not very configurable, and completely ignores design practices I think I would expect an API provider to provide, like a client. Integrating it into our project required manually editing a large script, and it's because of that, I couldn't quickly tell what was our changes or what was part of the example.\nGoing forward, it'd be best if we had an easy-to-use API client that we could make a small script to integrate with. Plenty of godot addons work in this way, it was strange to me that LootLocker didn't provide something like that.Priorities weren't there for me, this was too short a jam that demanded too much of my attention and time to make it worth it. It's because of this that I had to really think about what motivates me and what I want to work on going forward. <br>Music &amp; Audio -&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jaden-eubanks.itch.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://jaden-eubanks.itch.io/\" target=\"_self\">Jaden Eubanks</a><br>\nGameplay programmer &amp; Technical developer -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://caaz.itch.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://caaz.itch.io/\" target=\"_self\">Caaz</a> (That's me!)<br>\nGameplay programmer &amp; Technical developer -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://artur-gin.itch.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://artur-gin.itch.io/\" target=\"_self\">ArturGinRad</a><br>\nArt &amp; Animation -&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://pontax.itch.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://pontax.itch.io/\" target=\"_self\">Pontax</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":1,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Ideation","level":1,"id":"Ideation_0"},{"heading":"The plan","level":1,"id":"The_plan_0"},{"heading":"The execution","level":1,"id":"The_execution_0"},{"heading":"The results","level":1,"id":"The_results_0"},{"heading":"What could go better","level":1,"id":"What_could_go_better_0"},{"heading":"Research","level":2,"id":"Research_0"},{"heading":"Reusable Scenes","level":2,"id":"Reusable_Scenes_0"},{"heading":"Tileset utilization","level":2,"id":"Tileset_utilization_0"},{"heading":"UI Configuration","level":2,"id":"UI_Configuration_0"},{"heading":"LootLocker's script","level":2,"id":"LootLocker's_script_0"},{"heading":"Personal","level":2,"id":"Personal_0"},{"heading":"Floe credits","level":1,"id":"Floe_credits_0"}],"links":["notes/godot/node-and-scene-references.html#_0"],"author":"Daniel Cavazos","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"caaz.me/notes/retrospectives/floe.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":0,"modifiedTime":1733715876445,"sourceSize":6561,"sourcePath":"Notes/Retrospectives/FLOE.md","exportPath":"notes/retrospectives/floe.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"game-ideas.html":{"title":"Game Ideas","icon":"<span class=\"cm-iconize-icon\" aria-label=\"LiLightbulb\" data-icon=\"LiLightbulb\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: inline-flex; transform: translateY(13%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-lightbulb\"><path d=\"M15 14c.2-1 .7-1.7 1.5-2.5 1-.9 1.5-2.2 1.5-3.5A6 6 0 0 0 6 8c0 1 .2 2.2 1.5 3.5.7.7 1.3 1.5 1.5 2.5\"></path><path d=\"M9 18h6\"></path><path d=\"M10 22h4\"></path></svg></span>","description":"I like most game developers have many, many ideas.

Many of the links may shift with time, and the documents within them may change as well, if you'd like to save a particular page for long term use, you're likely better off finding the commit in the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/Caaz/caaz.github.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/Caaz/caaz.github.io\" target=\"_self\">public github repository</a> for this site and saving that. To view and edit files on this site, I use <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://obsidian.md/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://obsidian.md/\" target=\"_self\">Obsidian</a>, there's a vault in the repo that uses an html export feature to generate this site, with a few tweaks here and there for style and icon changes.Here, I'll write up game design documents, sometimes these will be just practice to get an idea of how to write one of these properly and get feedback, other times they may be actual games I plan on creating. In either case, you are free to use the ideas there for your own games, worst case scenario I can't imagine anyone would be able to create exactly the game I have in mind, and if they do, well then I don't have to make it, win win!<br>\nUsually, I'll try to think of a one-sentence-pitch before writing a design document, you can find those over in <a data-href=\"Game Ideas\" href=\"caaz.me/game-ideas.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"iconize-icon-in-link\" title=\"LiLightbulb\" aria-label=\"LiLightbulb\" data-icon=\"LiLightbulb\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"transform: translateY(20%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-lightbulb\"><path d=\"M15 14c.2-1 .7-1.7 1.5-2.5 1-.9 1.5-2.2 1.5-3.5A6 6 0 0 0 6 8c0 1 .2 2.2 1.5 3.5.7.7 1.3 1.5 1.5 2.5\"></path><path d=\"M9 18h6\"></path><path d=\"M10 22h4\"></path></svg></span>Game Ideas</a>Everything you find here will be personal opinions, written from my point of view regarding development, project management, retrospectives and the likes.

Over the years I've really discovered what values I consider important to me while working, and I think those values would be useful to those who want to work with me in the future.\nHere you can get the best idea of how best to utilize my skills and worth ethics to ensure my productivity is maximized and your expectations are in line with what quality I can provide.One of my major motivators is learning, everything else is second to that. I find enjoyment in learning new skills and applying them, and when I'm not doing that, it's all just busywork. I don't enjoy taking on projects that I know I can do, I prefer to push my limits and ensure I get the maximum value out of everything I work on.\nI enjoy problem solving, I enjoy what I do. Don't make my work about money, I could work anywhere doing anything for money, If I agree to work on a project, it's because I want to, not because I have to.Product requirements, feature specifications, team agreements. Those should be a requirement before starting feature work. If the team isn't on the same page it is near impossible to work together effectively.\nAs a developer, I've always preferred a by-the-book approach to working in a team, without established guidelines, it's very difficult to even begin working together, as naming conventions, coding patterns, and approaches to problems can vary wildly. Documentation ensures all developers are guiding the code in the same direction.While developing, there's a common saying: \"Make it work, make it right, make it fast.\" However, a lot of developers stop at making it work, and considering that \"done.\" This is especially prevalent under tight deadlines, and I've seen this time and time again at startups and in game jams.\nI believe, even under tight deadlines, at the very least, \"make it right\" must be reached. This means good architecture and code patterns, and being aware of when a pattern can become a problem.If you want me in a meeting, serve a clear purpose. If you put me in a meeting where my participation is not explicitly required I will tune out the entire thing and socially auto-pilot my way through it all.\nI don't actually mind meetings, I could sit in one all day, but you won't get productivity code-wise out of me during one. I am near incapable of writing code while listening to people talk.Well, if you can get behind my key values, what I stand for as a developer, then feel free to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Index > Contact\" data-href=\"Index#Contact\" href=\"caaz.me/index.html#Contact_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">contact me</a>.

I'm given a task and I do it. It's entirely reasonable for most managers and leads to see my job and skills and expect it to end there. Though it's rare, I've been in teams where managers and leads have requested feedback, and adjusted processes to ensure that everything works smoothly for all contributors on a project.\nI believe this strategy of giving ICs a voice in a project can lead to great boosts in not only productivity but also work ethic and attention from contributors. If you let ICs guide the project, they will have some personal ownership of it, and want it to succeed. If you silence them and use them as a tool, they're only going to care that their task is done at the end of the day.This is a work in progress! I'm absolutely still writing this, but also, you can expect it to evolve with time, as I learn what works, gauge feedback, and try to keep my opinion from muddying the waters too much of what I believe could be a reasonable collective working environment.\nThis document is how I would organize a team. I don't know if it would work, I don't know if people would be on board. I am not a lawyer, I know nothing of business, I'm just a guy, so take everything with a grain of salt.This document is written as an agreement of key values by means of consistent practices. Should the team find those practices and values lacking in any way, they can be modified through a voting method.

This document can be modified, and a decision of whether or not to go forward with the changes should be voted on.\nThe primary communication method should be through a team chat, allowing members of various time zones to read up and see what they've missed.\nThe team should do their best to organize chats into channels or threads, to ensure members of a particular skill know where to look for information that pertains to them. The team should refrain from having private conversations about team decisions, as that may lead to needing to reiterate context that would've been already handled if it were a public conversation. Private chats should be truly private, keep work chat public for all members to be kept up to date and on the same page. There are decent reasons to have meetings, though like private conversations, it requires people to be there or they miss out on context. Meetings should be optional, rare, and preferably fun. Public communications should be friendly, respectful, and understanding. As a team, we represent each other.\nA living document should exist to answer the following questions.\nWhat is the current Active project?\nWhat are the current decisions to be made?\nIf the choice is a simple A/B option, such as yes or no, or deciding between two options\nMembers chose either A, B or Abstain\nTally up all votes, majority wins. On the case of a tie, discuss more and try again. If the choice is between many options, such as between a list of options:\nMembers are given x/2+%2 votes, where x is the amount of option. for example: given 5 options they're given 3 votes, which they can distribute as they wish. [3,2,1,0,0], [3,0,1,1,1], [1,3,0,0,1]\nOnce all votes have been distributed, tally up all the votes If there's a majority winner, that is chosen as the option\nOn the case of a tied majority, divide the amount of options by removing the bottom voted choices (rounded down) and revoting.
