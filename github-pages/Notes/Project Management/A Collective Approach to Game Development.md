# Preface
For much of my career I have primarily just been an individual contributor, an IC. I'm given a task and I do it. It's entirely reasonable for most managers and leads to see my job and skills and expect it to end there. Though it's rare, I've been in teams where managers and leads have requested feedback, and adjusted processes to ensure that everything works smoothly for all contributors on a project. 
I believe this strategy of giving ICs a voice in a project can lead to great boosts in not only productivity but also work ethic and attention from contributors. If you let ICs guide the project, they will have some personal ownership of it, and want it to succeed. If you silence them and use them as a tool, they're only going to care that their task is done at the end of the day.
This document is how I would organize a game development team, with this management approach used to its fullest benefits. I don't know if it would work, I don't know if people would be on board. I am not a lawyer or a business major, so take everything with a grain of salt. Everything you see here is subject to change with time as I learn what works and what doesn't.
# Introduction

# Team Structure

# Funding
Through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) we can organize funds very transparently, the entire team as well as the public will be able to easily see what income we have, and what we're using it for. The public can donate to the collective one time, or recurring.
Open Collective's transparent finance history should allow us to have reasonable expectations for what we can afford to do, and we can pivot with everyone on the same page regarding the finances.
