# Preface
For much of my career I have primarily just been an individual contributor, an IC. I'm given a task and I do it. It's entirely reasonable for most managers and leads to see my job and skills and expect it to end there. Though it's rare, I've been in teams where managers and leads have requested feedback, and adjusted processes to ensure that everything works smoothly for all contributors on a project. 
I believe this strategy of giving ICs a voice in a project can lead to great boosts in not only productivity but also work ethic and attention from contributors. If you let ICs guide the project, they will have some personal ownership of it, and want it to succeed. If you silence them and use them as a tool, they're only going to care that their task is done at the end of the day.
This document is how I would organize a game development team, with this management approach used to its fullest benefits. I don't know if it would work, I don't know if people would be on board. I am not a lawyer or a business major, so take everything with a grain of salt. Everything you see here is subject to change with time as I learn what works and what doesn't.

# Key Values
## Every member has a voice.
1. Through [[#Decision making via voting]], we ensure every member has a say in every team-level decision.
## Every member is on the same page.
1. Through [[#A living document for team-level priorities]], we ensure every member is aware of which decisions are being made, and what the primary focus is.
2. Through [[#Transparent financing]], we ensure every member has reasonable expectations of how much we can afford.
# Processes
## A living document for team-level priorities
Every member must be clear on the priorities of the team. A living document should exist to answer the following questions.
- What is the current **Active project**?
- What are the current **decisions** to be made?
## Decision making via voting
### Two-choice
If the choice is a simple A/B option, such as yes or no, or deciding between two options
1. Members chose either A, B or Abstain
2. Tally up all votes, majority wins.
	1. On the case of a tie, discuss more and try again.
### Multi-choice
If the choice is between many options, such as between a list of options:
1. Members are given `x/2+%2` votes, where x is the amount of option. for example: given 5 options they're given 3 votes, which they can distribute as they wish. `[3,2,1,0,0]`, `[3,0,1,1,1]`, `[1,3,0,0,1]`
2. Once all votes have been distributed, tally up all the votes
	1. If there's a majority winner, that is chosen as the option
	2. On the case of a tied majority, divide the amount of options by removing the bottom voted choices (rounded down) and revoting. 
		1. If only two options are left, use the 2 choice voting system described above.
