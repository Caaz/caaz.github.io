Hi! My name is Daniel, but I usually go by Caaz. Welcome to my github.io. I plan on treating this as a bit of a personal blog, where I'll rant into the void, and those rantings may or may not get linked to someone at some point.

If you're looking to work with me, you should probably get to know what it's like [[Working With Me]] first. Otherwise, I'm always free to talk. The best way for internet strangers to reach me is through [bluesky @caaz.me](https://bsky.app/profile/caaz.me).
