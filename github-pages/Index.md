# About me
Hi! My name is Daniel, but I usually go by Caaz. I'm a developer of many things, and this site is where I publish living documents, these somewhat operate as a blog, though you can expect the pages to be refactored and change with time as I learn. 

# What's here
## Game Design Documents
Here, I'll write up game design documents, sometimes these will be just practice to get an idea of how to write one of these properly and get feedback, other times they may be actual games I plan on creating. In either case, you are free to use the ideas there for your own games, worst case scenario I can't imagine anyone would be able to create exactly the game I have in mind, and if they do, well then I don't have to make it, win win!
Usually, I'll try to think of a one-sentence-pitch before writing a design document, you can find those over in [[Game Ideas]]

## Notes
Notes you find here will be things I've picked up from videos or through running into issues myself. These I hope to serve as a font of knowledge for other developers.

# Contact
If you're looking to work with me, you should probably get to know what it's like [[Working With Me]] first. Otherwise, I'm always free to talk. The best way for internet strangers to reach me is through [bluesky @caaz.me](https://bsky.app/profile/caaz.me).
